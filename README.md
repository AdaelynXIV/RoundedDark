# Crescendum [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/AdaelynXIV/RoundedDark?color=gree&label=release&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/AdaelynXIV/RoundedDark/releases/latest)
A fork of [RoundedDark by AdaelynXIV](https://github.com/AdaelynXIV/RoundedDark) customized for my own personal preference. This theme is designed to be used with [ChannelTabs](https://betterdiscord.app/plugin/ChannelTabs).
